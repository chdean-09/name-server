# ESP32 Compilation Error Fixes

## 🚨 **BLE Library Conflict Issue**

You have two BLE libraries installed, causing conflicts:
- `C:\Users\asus\Documents\Arduino\libraries\ESP32_BLE_Arduino` (User library)
- `C:\Users\asus\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\esp32\hardware\esp32\3.2.0\libraries\BLE` (ESP32 Core library)

## 🛠️ **Solution:**

### **Option 1: Remove User-Installed BLE Library (Recommended)**
1. **Navigate to:** `C:\Users\asus\Documents\Arduino\libraries\`
2. **Delete folder:** `ESP32_BLE_Arduino`
3. **Use the built-in ESP32 BLE library** (cleaner, more compatible)

### **Option 2: Use User Library (If needed for specific features)**
1. **Keep** `ESP32_BLE_Arduino` library
2. **Disable ESP32 core BLE** by adding this line at the top of your code:
   ```cpp
   #define CONFIG_BT_ENABLED 1
   ```

## 📝 **Code Changes Applied:**

### ✅ **Fixed Issues:**
1. **Function Declarations**: Added forward declarations for all functions
2. **Switch Case Variables**: Fixed variable scope in `webSocketEvent()`
3. **String Conversion**: Changed `BLEDevice::init(deviceName)` to `BLEDevice::init(deviceName.c_str())`
4. **Missing Brace**: Fixed extra closing brace in `setupWebServer()`

### 🔧 **Updated Code Sections:**
- Added forward function declarations
- Fixed switch case variable initialization
- Fixed BLE device initialization
- Corrected function structure

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**

1. **Delete the ESP32_BLE_Arduino library folder**
2. **Recompile your code** - it should now work with the built-in ESP32 BLE library
3. **If issues persist**, restart Arduino IDE

## 📚 **Alternative: Update ESP32 Core**

If you continue having issues, try updating your ESP32 board package:
1. **Tools → Board → Boards Manager**
2. **Search:** "ESP32"
3. **Update** to latest version (3.2.0 or newer)

The code is now fixed and should compile successfully after resolving the library conflict!
